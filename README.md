Mass Detection in Breast Using Transfer Learning for Computer Aided Diagnosis
Mammography is the most widely used gold
standard method for the screening of the breast cancer and Mass
detection is the prominent pre-processing step. State-of-art
performances of the DCNN architectures in the field of
classification made them an obvious choice for the image
classifications. However, due to limited availability of medical
data, application of DCNN architectures in medical images is
challenging. In this project our contribution was mass detection in
mammographic images using two different approaches. First
approach was applying transfer learning concept which lessen the
demand of data to use a pre-trained publicly available VGG16
model and second approach was training a Alexnet from the
scratch to classify mass and non-mass mammographic images.
Both the models were trained and tested with different
hyperparameters and different data size. From the experiment
results, it can be concluded that transfer learning approach for
VGG16, training from fully connected layer 2 (fc2) has promising
expected result for mass detection. In our research, maximum
accuracy for mass detection was 93.60 % for VGG16 with 13500
train images
